# Paper topics for Duality Theory

## Comments

Here I collect some possible topics for your final essay. (I might also still add more and update the present ones.) Just to be sure, the suggested topics are meant as first ideas. It is part of the task of writing an essay to turn an interesting aspect of the suggested topic into a precise research question and collect the relevant literature on it. Please have a look at the grading criteria mentioned in the file [`formalities.pdf`](formalities.pdf) to get a clear idea of what a good essay is expected to look like. 

Overall, the topics follow the pattern of applying the formal tools of duality theory to some philosophical topic. So they are an instance of the method of mathematical philosophy: 
1. Start with an interesting philosophical phenomenon.
2. Model it with an appropriate mathematical structure.
3. Study this structure with mathematical techniques.
4. Translate the mathematical results back to the philosophical setting.
5. Critically assess the formalization: Do the mathematical results yield genuinely new philosophical insights? Where is the mathematical formalization not precise enough? Where is it overly precise?  

Many of the suggested topics below are also found as exercises at the end of the introduction chapter. So they concern the philosophical phenomena that we used at the beginning of the course to motivate the formal duality which we have subsequently studied. So also have a look again at this introduction chapter for more background.
