Welcome to the course _Duality Theory: Connecting Logic, Algebra, and Topology_! It is given during the winter semester 2025/6 at _LMU Munich_ as part of the _Master in Logic and Philosophy of Science_. (Past editions: winter 2023/4, winter 2024/5.)


# Motivation 

This course is an introduction to duality theory, which is an exciting area of logic and neighboring subjects like math and computer science. The fundamental theorem is Stone's duality theorem stating that certain algebras (Boolean algebras) are in a precise sense equivalent to certain topological spaces (totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces). The underlying idea is that the two seemingly different perspectives—the algebraic one and the spatial one—are really two sides of the same coin:

* formulas/propositions vs. models/possible worlds,
* open sets of a space vs. points of the space,
* properties of a computational process vs. denotation of the computational process.

In terms of content, the focus of the course will be to introduce the mathematical theory, after a philosophical motivation. In terms of skills, the aim is to learn how to apply the tools of duality theory. We will illustrate this with applications—especially to philosophical phenomena—that make use of dualities by combining the often opposing advantages of the two perspectives.


# General information

We have one session per week during the semester:

1. The _lecture_ given by me, [Levin Hornischer](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/hornischer_levin/index.html), on Thursdays from 10:00 to 12:00 in room 028 (Ludwigstr. 31). Note the sharp (aka "s.t.") times!

# Lecture Notes

The lecture notes are written as the course progresses. You find the latest edition here: [`duality.pdf`](duality.pdf).


# Formalities

All the organizational details for the course are described in this file: [`formalities.pdf`](formalities.pdf).


# Schedule

The schedule below describes in which week we will cover which material in the lecture, and it recommends exercises. The future part of the schdule is preliminary and will be updated according to what we actually have done in the lecture.

# Assessment

There will be a written exam in the last session, which determines your final grade. I plan to provide a practice exam further into the course.

(In the previous year, the assessment was via an essay. Should you want to take a look at the potential essay topics back then, you can go [here](topics.md).)
