Welcome to the course _Duality Theory: Connecting Logic, Algebra, and Topology _! It is given during the winter semester 2024/5 at _LMU Munich_ as part of the _Master in Logic and Philosophy of Science_. 


# Motivation 

This course is an introduction to duality theory, which is an exciting area of logic and neighboring subjects like math and computer science. The fundamental theorem is Stone's duality theorem stating that certain algebras (Boolean algebras) are in a precise sense equivalent to certain topological spaces (totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces). The underlying idea is that the two seemingly different perspectives—the algebraic one and the spatial one—are really two sides of the same coin:

* formulas/propositions vs. models/possible worlds,
* open sets of a space vs. points of the space,
* properties of a computational process vs. denotation of the computational process.

In terms of content, the focus of the course will be to introduce the mathematical theory, after a philosohical motivation. In terms of skills, the aim is to learn how to apply the tools of duality theory. We will illustrate this with applications—especially to philosophical phenomena—that make use of dualities by combining the often opposing advantages of the two perspectives.


# General information

We have two sessions per week during the semester:

1. The _lecture_ given by me, [Levin Hornischer](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/hornischer_levin/index.html), on Wednesdays from 12:00 to 14:00 in room 021 (Ludwigstr. 31). Note the sharp (aka "s.t.") times! Here the main content of the course is introduced. Below you find a schedule of when we cover which topic. 

2. The _exercise class_ given by [Marta Esteves](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/doct_fellows/esteves_marta/index.html), on Thursdays from 18:15 to 19:45 in room 028 (Ludwigstr. 31). Here the solutions to the homework exercises are discussed.


# Lecture Notes

The lecture notes are written as the course progresses. You find the latest edition here: TBA.

They are a rewritten version of last year's notes, which you can find [here](duality_old.pdf).


# Formalities

All the organizational details for the course are described in this file: [`formalities.pdf`](formalities.pdf).


# Schedule

The schedule below describes in which week we will cover which material in, respectively, the lecture and the exercise class. The 'Date' is the Wednesday of the week, i.e., when the lecture takes place; the exercise class is a day later.
